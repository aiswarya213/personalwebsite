                I am a BSc graduate from Naipunnya School of Management which is under the Kerala University. I'm currently pursuing 
                a master's degree in MVoc Software Application Development at Cochin University of Arts and Science. During my under-graduation 
                I completed two projects: one minor and one major. My minor project, MOTOFIX, is a car service website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                My major project, FRAUDACTION, focuses on fraud detection in online transactions and purchasing, developed using Python and Django.
